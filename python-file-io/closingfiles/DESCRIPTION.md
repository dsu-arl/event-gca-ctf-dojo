# Closing Files

In our challenges so far, we have only been opening files, we haven't been closing them. With Python, this is typically fine; however, it is best practice to close a file object when you're done using it. To close a file object, you just have to call the `close` method on it after you're done using it. 

Using Python:
1. Create a new file called `closing.txt`.
2. Write data to it.
3. Close the file object.
4. Run your python script by using the command `python <your_python_file.py>`

Run `/challenge/verify <your_python_file>` to get your flag!
