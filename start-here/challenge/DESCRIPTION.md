## Challenge Description
Most challenges will have files stored in the `/challenge` directory.
A directory is just a folder that you can store files in. 
The last challenge ran a file automatically when the terminal was opened, but this challenge requires you to run the file yourself. 
You will need to run the `/challenge/solve` file to get the flag.
There are a few different ways to run files, depending on the file type.
For most challenge files, you simply need to type the program name and hit `Enter` 

## Challenge Steps
1. Open a terminal in either the VSCode Workspace or the Desktop
2. Type `/challenge/solve` in the terminal and press `Enter`
3. Submit the flag!
