Next, we will explore the Desktop!
The GUI Desktop is a virtual machine running a Linux operating system. 
Try out the challenges in the Linux Fundamentals and Linux Admin modules to learn more!

NOTE: To make/edit files from the Desktop terminal, check out Linux Fundamentals! (You'll need to know this for many future challenges.)

## Challenge steps
1. Start the challenge
2. Open the GUI Desktop - either click "Desktop" in the top navigation tab, or "GUI Desktop Workspace" when the blue banner pops up below.
3. Open a terminal inside the Desktop - click the black box at the bottom of the desktop
4. Once the terminal is open, your flag will appear! 
5. Follow the steps given in the terminal to submit your flag. Copy/pasting from the Desktop is a bit tricky!
