Now that you know how to use Beautiful Soup to grab desired tags and information from a page we will test your skills. In this challenge you will be presented with HTML code that represents a table. This table contains a list of many items. Their name, product category, price, and product number. Using requests to get the HTML code from the webpage, and Beautiful Soup to parse that data, you must:

1. Tell me how many products are within the price range of $20 - $50.
2. Get the Product Number for the "Kitchen Knife Set".
3. Tell me what the cheapest product in the table is.

You can format your data as follows:

```python
data = {'answer1': INTEGER, 'answer2': STRING OR INTEGER, 'answer3': STRING}
```

This challenge is relatively difficult and will test what you've learned with requests, beautifulsoup, and python in general. It may take some time to complete fully and you may need to use outside resources.
