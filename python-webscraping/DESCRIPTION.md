# Web Scraping with Python

What is web scraping? It's exactly what it sounds like! You will be scraping webpages on the internet for data. This is very vague because Web Scrapers have many different uses. There is a lot of different forms of information on the internet that we are able to get. Maybe you want to collect news articles about a specific event across multiple news sites into one place. Perhaps you want to scrape and download free pdf's from a website rather than having to go and click each link to download them.

You can have a lot of fun with web scraping, and Python makes it very easy to do!

# Disclaimer:
Web scraping can involve legal and ethical considerations. Many websites have terms of service (ToS) that explicitly prohibit scraping. Violating these terms could lead to legal consequences under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the U.S. or equivalent laws in other countries. Additionally, scraping personal or sensitive data may violate privacy laws like GDPR (Europe) or CCPA (California). Always check a website's ToS and ensure compliance with local laws before scraping.
