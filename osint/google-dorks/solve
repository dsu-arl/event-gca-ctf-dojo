    Google "dorking" is a way of searching for information in a more advanced way. Below are some of the common keywords
    and symbols that can be used:

    OR - used to search for one thing 'or' another thing
        Example: apples OR oranges
          This will find results for apples or oranges.
    
    AND - used to search for one thing 'and' another thing
        Example: apples AND oranges
          This will find results for apples and also oranges.

    Quotes - use quotes around a search term to search for pages that explicitly have that text
        Example: "Dakota State University"
          This will find pages that have the exact text "Dakota State University".

    site:DOMAIN - used to only show results from a specific site
          Example: site:dsu.edu "academic"
            This will find the exact text "academic" on the dsu.edu website.

    There are many other things you can do with Google dorks, too much to list here.

    With the information provided here, use a Google dork to tell me the two professors at DSU that have
    the last name of "Richardson".
