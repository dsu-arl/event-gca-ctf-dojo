What in the world are Google dorks?? I'm a bit of a Google dork... I use it every day.

Google "dorking" is a technique of searching Google (or other search engines) that makes use of
special operators to search for very specific information. Dorks can be used to find information
that would otherwise be difficult to find via regular Google searches.

Run `/challenge/solve` to get started.
