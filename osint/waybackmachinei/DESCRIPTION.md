# Wayback Machine I

The internet is a great place to find information on basically anything. That also makes it scary.

You know how people say, "if it's on the internet, it's forever." Whether that's true or not is up for debate, but we should treat it as if it is true, because functionally it is. Tools like `The Wayback Machine` at `web.archive.org` have made it their goal to `archive` the entire internet. This is done imperfectly and doesn't preserve every website at every moment of history, but they have archived over 916 billion web pages, spanning decades, since the project started. 

Tools like the Wayback Machine are useful to us when we are trying to find certain information that may not necessarily exist on a website anymore. For example, maybe you want to reread a blog post from an old website that has since been changed. If that old site was archived by the Wayback Machine you can look up the URL, and select the proper year and month, and actually view that blog post from that point in time (assuming it was archived). 

The Wayback Machine has sites archived from 1996 all the way up to our current day. This means there exists a wide breadth of data for us to potentially find information we need.

# How To Use

1. Browse to web.archive.org.
2. Enter a website URL into the search bar. For testing you can do `dsu.edu`
	* Once the results are displayed, you should see a calendar with each month and day, as well as a selector above that to pick the year.
3. Select a year, month, and a day.
	1. Click a black bar within any of the years (the black bar means there is archived data for that year).
	2. Find a month that has blue or green dots on some of the days, and hover over it. It should display times that snapshots were taken of the webpage. 
4. Click a time in the selection to load that archived version of the webpage.
5. Browse the webpage as normal!

# Conclusion

You can see that the Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that can be used for many purposes when performing OSINT. In this challenge, you will be asked to use the Wayback Machine to locate information from a website that no longer exists on it today!

Start the challenge and then run `/challenge/run` to get your challenge! You will need to use your own local browser to access the Wayback Machine!

Once you find the information required, run `verify` and it will ask for your answer! Submit it, and get the flag!
