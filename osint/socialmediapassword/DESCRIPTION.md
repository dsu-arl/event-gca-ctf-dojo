# Social Media OSINT

Social media is a fun place where we get to post about our lives, share moments that mean the most to us, and connect with friends. However, since we typically post more about ourselves than we realize, attackers can use the information we freely provide to hack into our accounts.

One of the most common ways Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is used, is by collecting personal information on a target and using that information to create a list of possible passwords they may use.

This is a successful attack because most user's passwords are not strong. They may include their birth year (ex. Balogna2005), their pet's names, (ex. Rex123!), or things surrounding their hobbies (ex. ILoveFishing99).

Since most online users want to remember their passwords, they pick easy to remember things in their life to formulate them; but a lot of what they pick are things they also freely share on social media.

In this challenge, you will see a fake social media page that contains information on a particular individual known as `@random_dude12`. It is up to you to use the information within the three posts to try and come up with a potential password for the users account.

Start the machine, then run `/challenge/run` in the terminal to start the website. Then in a browser, browse to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the crude Instagram clone!

Gather information from reading the posts so you can craft a potential password! Then run `/challenge/verify` to see if your password is valid given the information!
