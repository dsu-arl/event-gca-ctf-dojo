**Challenge Name: Phreaking**

**Description:**

Phone phreaking, is a classic example of hackers taking advantage of available features in a system.  
Phones used to use a special system of high frequencies, nearly inperceptible to the human ear. These tones were used to control routing information and even authentication for users on the phone network. In the 1960s, a device known as a blue box was concieved, this device was created to automate the process of disconnecting long distance calls and providing new routing instructions to the phone line.

This meant that toll free calls (1-800 numbers) could be made, disconnected, and therefore used to bypass the need to pay for call routing.

A simplified version of this process has been created for this challenge. You must use the [bluebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_box) to play [dtmf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTMF_signaling) tones into the phone booth. Your goal is to call Lucy for free!

1. Dial a toll-free line
2. Reset the trunk 
3. Use the special code to switch to a local call
4. Set the routing
5. Use the status function to activate the call
6. Place the free call to Lucy
