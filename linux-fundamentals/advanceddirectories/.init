Dearest Pookie,

Your going away has cast a shadow on my heart.
It's as if you were my sun, and as you set over 
the horizon, only darkness remains.

The twilight of my soul has brought upon me
exceeding anguish. No vice I turn to can
procure satisfaction. The longings of my heart
cannot be fulfilled by material extravagance.

Oh, to see you again, Pookie. Your presence 
is like a cool breeze on a hot day. A warm
drink on a freezing evening. 

Make haste to reply to me. Your words move
my heart to rejoice.

In love,
Bernard Carburetor IV.
EOT
