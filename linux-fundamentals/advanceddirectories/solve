    We all have a lot of documents on our computers.
    They are filled with a lot of ideas that span
    across many different topics. It helps to keep
    them organized!

    One of the best ways to do that is by creating
    a new directory (folder) for them!

    You're a fun person, and you have an interest
    in ostriches! You want to keep all of your
    writing and research about ostriches in one
    place so it's easy to find!

    For this challenge, first, make sure you're in
    your home directory by typing 'pwd' and making
    sure the output says:

        /home/hacker

        * If it doesn't, then type 'cd /home/hacker'
          to change to your home directory!

    Now that you're home, make a directory called 
    'ostrich_research' using the 'mkdir' command
    to store all of your documents on ostriches!

        'mkdir {name_of_directory}'

    """)

def rmdir_check():

    if 'old_stuff' not in listdir('/home/hacker'):
        return True
    return False

def rmdir_instructions():
    print("""
    Great job!

    Now that you know how to make a new directory
    we should show you how to delete a directory!
    
    In your home directory there exists a directory
    called 'old_stuff'. It's full of a bunch of 
    old files you want to get rid of. If you want
    you can read through them using the 'cat'
    command a take a trip down memory lane!

    Once you're ready to delete the directory, you'll
    want to use the 'rmdir' command to do so! It's
    easy to remember!

        'rmdir {name_of_directory}'

    You may run into complications, are you able to
    solve the problem and get past it?

    Awesome!

    I want to show you one last thing with directories!

    In the first challenge you learned about 'ls' and
    how to view the contents of directories. Well, what
    if there was a way to view files that were hidden?

    There is! You just have to pass a flag to the 'ls'
    command to tell it you want to view hidden files.

    Hidden files are files that have a dot (.) in front
    of their name. This means they wont show up if you just 
    type 'ls'.

    However, if we pass the 'a' flag to ls, we can view
    hidden files! To do this we have to run ls as follows:

        'ls -a' 

        * Notice the dash (-) in the command. A dash
          is required to denote that 'a' is a flag
          for ls.

    In your home directory find a hidden password file,
    'cat' the file, and copy it's contents. 

    You will then run '/challenge/solve' and supply the
    password!
