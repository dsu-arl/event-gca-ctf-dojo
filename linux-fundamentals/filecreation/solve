        For the first part of this challenge you will
        create a file.

        To do that, you will need the 'touch' command.

        To create a file, you just run the command
        'touch {filename}' where filename is whatever
        you want to name it. This creates an empty file
        with no contents in it.

        To pass this first part you must navigate to
        the '/tmp/starthere/' directory and then
        create a file in that directory with whatever
        name you want to give it.

        After that, run '/challenge/solve' again to 
        move on!

        Navigate to the directory '/tmp/lorum'
        and use the 'rm' command to remove the
        file 'ipsum.txt'. 

        'rm' stands for remove... so it's easy
        to remember! Usage: 'rm {filename}'.

        Once you have deleted the file, run
        '/challenge/solve' one last time to
