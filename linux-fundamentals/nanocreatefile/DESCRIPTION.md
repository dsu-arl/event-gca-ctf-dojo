Before you start this challenge, you should have some understanding of nano.

# Nano Text Editor

In Linux, while you're using the command line, you want a way to edit files. On Windows we can open up notepad, Microsoft Word, or Visual Studio Code. We don't have access to these tools because they are graphical tools. However, the Linux command line offers a wide range of text editors that we can use. One of which is called `nano`.

You can use Nano by typing the command 'nano' in the terminal. You can then begin writing text to the screen as if you were using notepad on Windows. To move around in `nano` you can use the arrow keys. The only difference is that you can't use your mouse to click 'file' and then 'save as', you have to use Keyboard shortcuts. You're familiar already with certain keybaord shortcuts such as Ctrl+c to copy, and Ctrl+v to paste.

In nano, they provide you with all of the keyboard shortcuts you will need to use at the bottom of your screen. It shows you the shortcut you need to enter with the syntax of up carrot '^' and then a letter following it. The up carrot ('^') means you have to hold the control key and then hit the letter that follows to execute the proper function. To save a file, you will use the 'Write Out' shortcut to save your file. You will be prompted if you want to "Save modified buffer", you can then hit the 'y' key for yes, then it will ask for a filename at the bottom of the screen. Type the filename you want, and then hit enter. Then to exit, enter the right shortcut to exit that is found at the bottom the screen.

To complete this challenge you use nano to create a file named `my_nano_file.txt` in your home directory (you should be there by default). This file should contain the phrase "When one does not love too much, one does not love enough." When you have put the text in nano, save it and exit, then run `/challenge/solve`.
