            Traveling through linux directories is a very simple task!
            To start off, a directory is just a folder where files, or
            even other folders are stored.

            On the linux command line, since you don't have a graphical
            user interface, all of your operations need to be done by 
            typing commands.

            The first command you need to know is 'ls'. The 'ls' command
            simply lists the contents of the directory you are currently in.
            If you want to know what directory you are currently in, you can
            type the 'pwd' command. This stands for 'print working directory.'

            The second command you need to know is 'cd'. The 'cd' command
            stands for 'change directory'. It allows you to move through
            directories on linux to find the files you need.

            For this challenge you will need to change directories into 
            the /tmp directory by typing 'cd /tmp'. From there you can
            run 'ls' to list it's contents. You will then see a directory
            named 'starthere'. You can then run 'cd starthere' to enter that
            directory. 

            From here your goal is to look around the different directories
            within the starthere directory to find a file. That file will
            have a name that looks like this 'pwn_{random_word}_{random_word}_pwn.

            If you find yourself in a directory that is empty, type 'cd ..' to 
            go back one directory and change your course! 

            Then you can type '/challenge/solve' and enter the filename when 
            prompted to get your flag!

            Note: Type 'cd' without a directory name to return to your home 
            directory. You can also use the '/' tolink together directory 
            names, for example, "cd /tmp/starthere/...".
            
            Good luck!
