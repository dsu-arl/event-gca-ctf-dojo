# Object-oriented Programming

Python supports a particular form of programming called Object-oriented programming (OOP). In OOP, you can create objects that represent things and define what they do using methods (functions attached to objects). This sounds very vague, and that's because an object can represent pretty much anything.

For example, you can make a `Car` object with methods like `start`, `stop`, and `go`. Similarly, you can make a `Human` object with methods like `eat`, `sleep`, and `walk`. 

Object-Oriented Programming allows you to model real-world entities and their behavior in your code, making it easier to organize and manage complex programs.

In this module, you will learn the basics of creating objects in Python!
