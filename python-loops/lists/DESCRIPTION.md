
A list is a built-in data type in Python. A Python list is a sequence of comma seperated items, enclosed in square brackets. Every item in a list can be made up of any type of variable we have learned about so far, and they don't necessarily need to be the same type. 
**Examples of Python Lists:**
```
list1 = ["Thomas", "Jefferson", "President", 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
```

#### Challenge:
Use python to create 3 different lists
1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write python to create 3 python lists (a list of strings, a list of integers, and a list of floats)
3. Test your solution with `python yourFile.py`
4. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
