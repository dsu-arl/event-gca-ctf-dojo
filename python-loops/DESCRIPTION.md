Python supports Iterative Statements (Loops) and allow us to execute a statment or group of statements multiple times.

In general, programs are executed sequentially: the first statement in a program is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There can be situations in which you may need to execute a block of code several times, and that's where loops become beneficial.


This module is all about learning Python Loops. 
Topics to be covered: 
- While Loops
- Introduction to Python Lists
- `range()` Function
- For Loops.
