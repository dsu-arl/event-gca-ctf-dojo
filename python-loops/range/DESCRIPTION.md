Python also offers a built-in `range()` function that returns an iterator object, essentially a list of numbers. This object contains integers from start to stop and this can be used to run a for loop.

#### `range()` Syntax:
```
range(start, stop, step)
# Start is the starting value of the range. Optional. Default is 0.
# Stop is where range will stop, runs until stop-1.
# Step is how we want to increment the values in the range. Optional, default is 1.
```

#### Challenge:
Use python to see the different outputs of the `range()` command
1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write python to create 3 different `range()` calls, trying to use different start, stop, and step values.
3. Test your solution with `python yourFile.py`
4. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
