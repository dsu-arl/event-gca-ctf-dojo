The first thing to learn when programming is how to print information to the screen, as a program is only useful if you can see its results. In Python to print to the screen, we will use the `print()` function (we will cover functions in more detail later).

#### Print Syntax:
Text that you want to print, must be in quotes. Later, we will show you how to print other things too!
```python
print("STRING MESSAGE TO PRINT")
```


For example:
```python
print("My Output!!")
```
When run this will display the following:
```commandline
My Output!!
```

In addition to printing things to the screen, you sometimes need to add messages inside your code. This is called a comment. Comments can be useful to help explain Python code and make it more readable or to stop certain lines from executing. 

#### Comment Syntax:
```python
# This is a comment
```

Comments start with a `#`, this is vital because it tells Python to ignore what follows. Comments can be placed on their own line, or at the end of an existing lines.

For example:
```python
# This is a greeting print statement
print("GREETINGS USER!") # Another Comment, do you think this is a good greeting?
```


#### Challenge:
Use python to print the text 'Hello World!' to the screen.

1. Create a new file with the file extension `.py`
2. Write the python code to print the text `Hello World!`
3. Test your code with `python yourFile.py`
4. Verify your solution with `verify yourFile.py`
