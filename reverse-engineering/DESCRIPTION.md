## Welcome to the Reverse Engineering Module

This module will introduce different topics under the reverse engineering umbrella! Reverse engineering can be extremely complex involving many moving parts, or it can be as easy as parsing output from a tool. Broadly, reverse engineering can be divided into static and dynamic topics. Static does not execute the binary, while dynamic does.
