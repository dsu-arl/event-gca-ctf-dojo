Welcome! 
Each module below will teach you about different cybersecurity topics! 
Within each module are challenges - you will need to "capture the flag" to complete each challenge and earn points!
We suggest starting with the "Start Here!" module, to learn how the platform works. 
Then, if you are not familiar with Linux, work through the "Linux Fundamentals" module at a minimum. 
The python modules are also suggested to be completed in order, but feel free to skip ahead if you already have experience!
From there, you can start any module that sounds interesting to you.

Besides some challenges in the "Start Here!" module, all challenges were created by Dakota State University.
