## Challenge Description

Eli was known for his habit of staring deeply at paintings, studying every brushstroke, every subtle shift in color. He believed that beneath the surface of every piece, there was always something more to find. One day, he discovered an image that seemed perfectly smooth, its colors almost too serene. Yet, something felt different.

As Eli examined it closer, he realized that the painting wasn’t just a work of art—it was a puzzle.

What would he uncover? Only careful observation will reveal the hidden message within.
