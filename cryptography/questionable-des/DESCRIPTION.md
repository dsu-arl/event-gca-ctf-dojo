## Challenge Description
Alice and Bob like to have encrypted communications in secret. Their names happen to be the generic names used when talking about cryptography, so they have a bit of an ego when it comes to "secure" crypto. Given an intercepted ciphertext and the tool they used to generate it, can you figure out where they went wrong and decrypt their message?
