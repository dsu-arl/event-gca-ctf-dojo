## Challenge Description
Alice and Bob like to have encrypted communications in secret. Since their names happen to be the generic names used when talking about cryptography, they tend to have a bit of an ego when it comes to their homebrewed crypto. Given an intercepted ciphertext and the tool they used to generate it, can you figure out where they went wrong and decrypt their message?
