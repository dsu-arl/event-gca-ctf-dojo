Python program control flow is regulated by various types of statements. By default the instructions in a program are executed in a sequential manner (step-by-step), from start to end. However, sequentially executing programs can perform only simplistic tasks.

We would like the program to have decision-making ability, so that it performs different steps depending on different conditions. Python provides this functionality through two different statements: Decision Making Statements (**Conditional Statements**) and Iterative Statements (**Loops**). 

This module is all about learning Python supported conditional statements. 
Topics to be included: 
- If statements
- If-Else statements
- Nested Conditionals
- Else-If statements
- Logic Operators
