        In this challenge you are going to learn how to move
        already existing files! While we will be only moving
        text files (files ending with .txt) you are capable
        of moving everything, even entire directories!

        To do this we will use the command 'mv'. This is
        short for 'move'. To use this command you will follow
        this formula: 'mv {file_to_move} {destination}'.

        As an example, say we have a file named 
        'credit_card_info.txt' that we want to move into a 
        directory called 'secret'. We would run this command:

            'mv credit_card_info.txt secret/'

        Navigate to '/tmp/starthere/'. You will see three 
        text files and three directories. Sort the text
        files into their proper directories.

        Once you are done, run '/challenge/solve' to see if
        you passed!

        'gummy_worms.txt' to whatever other candy you enjoy! (If you
        enjoy gummy worms, I'm sorry, you still have to change it)

        To rename a file, we will still use the 'mv' command! However
        instead of moving the file into a different directory, we 
        will just move the file in place.

        The way we do that is by running 'mv {file_to_change} {changed_name}'

        Rename 'gummy_worms.txt' and then run '/challenge/solve' to
        pass the challenge!

        To copy a file we will use the 'cp' command! The proper way
        to use this command looks like this:

            'cp {file_to_copy} {destination}'

        Go ahead and copy the 'apple.txt' file in '/tmp/starthere/fruit'
