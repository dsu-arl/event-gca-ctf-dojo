## Challenge Description
Most challenges will have files stored in the `/challenge` directory.
A directory is just a folder that you can store files in. 
The last challenge ran a file automatically when the terminal was opened, but this challenge requires you to run the file yourself. 
You will need to run the `/challenge/solve` file to get the flag.
There are a few different ways to run files, depending on the file type.
For most challenge files, you simply need to type the program name and hit `Enter` 

## Challenge Steps
1. Start the VSCode Workspace
2. Open a terminal
3. Type `/challenge/solve` in the terminal and press `Enter`
4. Copy/paste the flag to submit!
