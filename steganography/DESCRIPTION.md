Steganography is the practice of hiding information within a file. Steganography focuses on making the messages undetectable.

It works by embedding secret data within a carrier file in a way that does not visibly alter the original file.
For example, in image steganography, secret information can be encoded into the least significant bits of pixel values, making it invisible to the naked eye.


Steganography is often used for covert communication and can also be combined with encryption for added security.
